# Waiter

Waiter serves up menus for your application:
* Provides a quick DSL for building menus, without having to specify any HTML.
* Makes assumptions based on what's provided in the DSL so that the specification does not need to be unnecessarily verbose.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'waiter'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install waiter

## Usage

### Building a menu

To create a new menu:

    Waiter::Menu.serve do |menu|
      menu.file
      menu.edit
      menu.view
      # ...
    end

The above defines a menu with three items. By default, each item name (ie. "file", "edit", etc.) corresponds both to the I18n string to use (so `menu.file` will call `I18n.t(:file)`) as well as to the controller to use (`menu.file` will correspond to `FileController`, and the menu item will link to `FileController#index` by default).

Of course, there will be situations where the path may need to be explicitly specified. In this case, the `:controller`
and `:action` options can be specified:

    Waiter::Menu.serve do |menu|
      menu.file :controller => 'documents', :action => 'show'
    end

In this case the File menu will correspond to `DocumentsController#show`, and will only light up for that action. If
no specific action is given, the menu item will be lit up for all actions within the given controller.

There may also be times where you need multiple controllers to light up the same menu item. This can be achieved by
passing an array to the `:controllers` option:

    Waiter::Menu.serve do |menu|
      menu.file :controller => 'documents', :controllers => ['files', 'print', ... ]
    end

This will create a menu that links to `DocumentsController#index`, which will be lit up the user hits any action within the `FilesController`, `PrintController`, as well as the `DocumentsController`.


### Submenus

Menus can also have submenus (currently only one level of nesting is supported when drawing a menu, but infinite
levels are supported when building a menu). A submenu is defined with the same syntax as a root menu item, and is
passed as a block to the root menu item.

Submenus automatically assume the controller to use is the controller specified by its root menu item, so a
controller does not need to be specified unless it differs. As well, the menu item name is assumed to be used
for the action within that controller, so action does not need to be specified unless it differs from the name.
An id can also be specified if necessary (with the `:id` option).

    Waiter::Menu.serve do |menu|
      menu.file, :controllers => ['print'] do |file|
        file.new                            # Corresponds to FileController#new
        file.open :action => :read          # Corresponds to FileController#read
        file.save :action => :write         # Corresponds to FileController#write
        file.print, :controller => 'print'  # Corresponds to PrintController#print
      end
    end

If an action isn't explicitly given, and the menu item name does not correspond to an actual action, the default
action for the controller will be used instead.


### Menu Options

There are two options that you can use when building your menu. Options can be passed into build when defining
a menu or specified once the menu is defined by accessing the menu.options hash.

`string_prefix`: Allows for a prefix for I18n strings to be specified.

    Waiter::Menu.serve(:string_prefix => 'menu_') do |menu|
      menu.file
    end

    # will use I18n.t(:menu_file) instead of I18n.t(:file)

`selected`: Allows the selected menu item to be overridden, so a specified menu item can be lit up regardless of
what the current controller/action is. This can be useful if there is an action that falls under different menu
items depending on application context, or if there is a controller that may correspond to multiple menu items.
A good way to achieve this would be to add a before_filter to set an instance variable which is then passed into
the selected option.

    before_filter :set_current_menu

    def set_current_menu
      case params[:action]
        when 'foo' then @current_menu = "menu1"
        when 'bar' then @current_menu = "menu2"
      end
    end

    Waiter::Menu.serve(:selected => @current_menu) do |menu|
    end

Note that the value passed to `:selected` should match the name of the menu item.


### Drawing (outputting) a menu

To draw a created menu, use the `Waiter::Menu::Drawer` class. The class requires the current context to be
passed in so that `ActionController` methods can be used. In general (ie. if the menu is being drawn from a helper)
the context is self.

    menu = Waiter::Menu.serve do |menu|
      # ...
    end

    Waiter::Menu::Drawer.new(menu, context).draw

If a different `Drawer` is desired, `Waiter::Menu::Drawer` can be subclassed and the methods `draw` and `draw_submenu` overridden to provide an alternate format.
